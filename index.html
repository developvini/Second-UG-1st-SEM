                <div class="card-body course-panel">
                  <h5 class="card-title">Introduction about the Author:</h5> 
                  <p class="card-text">Sarvepally Radhakrishnan was India’s president and vice-president. He was also a great thinker, teacher and pupil intellectual. Hs interest was in philosophy and religion. Ever year our country observes September, 5 the day on which Dr. S. Radhakrishnan was born as Teacher’s Day. The Bharat Ratna, India’s highest civilian honor was conferred on him in 1954. </p>
                  <h5 class="card-title">About the Essay:</h5> 
                  <p class="card-text">The essay discusses about the importance of education given in universities. He insists that any educational institutions must focus on both technological studies and the field of humanities. He also forecasts on the idea of the lack of any one of these studies in universities. Though the fields of religion and science are considered variant, according to Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, the common goal of religion and science is oneself. </p>
                  <h5 class="card-title">Three obstacles in the national development:</h5> 
                  <p class="card-text">Dr. S. Radhakrishnan identifies three main obstacles in the national development. They are: Ignorance, Poverty and Disease. It is like a chain – connected to one another. According to him, if Ignorance is eradicated the other two will be removed. He also moves his discussion to the factors that form a developed country. He says educated people who have competence and skill, sense of direction and a social purpose can transform the world. Technological education and humanities must be balanced in any universities. Science without moral values is not disciplined. Thus in creating a national development, technological education and humanistic studies must be merged together to create functional citizens to form a developed country.   </p>
                  <h5 class="card-title">Functions of Education:</h5> 
                  <p class="card-text">Dr. S. Radhakrishnan depicts that to make the student earn a living by himself is one of the main functions of education. In order to give him a career, he insists that technological education and humanities should be equally balances. To him, technological education without humanities is imperfect, lop –sided and deficient. Science is both knowledge and power. It has interest as well utility. It demands disciplined devotion to the pursuit of truth. It develops an attitude of tolerance, open – mindedness, freedom from prejudice and hospitality to new ideas. So, Dr. S. Radhakrishnan says technological education without science or vice versa can never progress any towards his own career.   </p>
                  <h5 class="card-title">Significance of the field of Humanities:</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">According to Radhakrishnan, like technological education and sciences, humanities are also an important field in education. Humanities become significant by telling our own nature and how humans have a deeper meditation over the subject of life. The obstacles to human well – being are in the minds of men. Hatred, folly and uncivil passions make a human being blind to truth. Hence in addition to technological education and science, humanistic studies will be helpful in understanding heart and wisdom.</p>
                  <h5 class="card-title">Knowledge, Wisdom and search for Truth:</h5>
                  <p class="card-text"> Dr. S.Radhakrishnan emphasizes that humans are oppressed by many evils like poverty, disease and ignorance. But he also says that these difficulties are not due to the forces outside but by the lack of wisdom. It is the human being who destroys the humanity. In order to reform one, they must aim at Atma Samskriti which is the development f human nature and refinement of human spirit. An insight into oneself and an insight into reality should be the end of all the disciplines. All sciences are available but it is the incapability of the human beings to comprehend it and use it for refining our own spirit. Adhyathma Vidya or the knowledge of our own self is the greatest science tells, Dr. S. Radhakrishnan.</p>
                  <h5 class="card-title">Conclusion:</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">Dr. S. Radhakrishnan writes his essay Humanities Vs Science to encrypt that no one is fully educated if his /her knowledge is limited to any one branch. He also says that universities can be regarded as true universities only when its men and women not only come out as learned individuals but whose hearts are full of compassions feeling for the suffering humanities. Thus he concludes that science, arts and humanities must be included in the field of education to make a citizen as a fully intellectual human fruitful for the society.   </p>

                <div class="card-body course-panel">
                  <h5 class="card-title">Introduction:</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">Oscar Wilde was a gifted British dramatist, playwright and a short-story writer. His best known literary work is the comedy The Importance of Being Ernest. His great short – stories include ‘The Happy Prince and other tales’ and ‘A House of Pomegranates’. Wilde’s stories are best known for its wit. He tries to explain the humorous situations and gives an insight into human nature. </p>
                  <h5 class="card-title">Hughie Erskine:</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">Hughie Erskine is the central figure of the story. He was good-looking, handsome and an attractive young man but he was poor. He had talented in everything except the aspect of making money. He was not rich and his father had never left anything except the ‘History of the Peninsula War’ and a sword. Ultimately he was a delightful gentleman ‘with a perfect profile and no profession’. The basic element that shaped his life was his love with Laura Merton, the daughter of a retired colonel. </p>
                  <h5 class="card-title">Problem in Marriage:</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">Hughie loved Laura Merton deeply and she responded to it honestly. The problem grew in the form of the character the Colonel. The Colonel had ordered Hughie to offer ten thousand pounds of his own and marry Laura Merton. Hughie had neither the choice of earning the money that the Colonel demanded nor surrendering his love for the sake of poverty. </p>
                  <h5 class="card-title">Hughie’s friendship with Alan Trevor:</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">Hughie had a strong friendship with Alan Trevor, a Painter. Though he was a rough fellow, he was much attracted to the charming attitude of Hughie. One day when Hughie went to Trevor’s studio, he saw Trevor painting a beggar. The beggar looked so poor an wore tattered clothes. His face was tired and he had a stick on one hand and a hat on the other hand. He looked so miserable that Hughie dropped a sovereign in his hat and left the studio. </p>
                  <h5 class="card-title">Truth behind the Beggar:</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">The next time when Alan Trevor met Hughie, he explained that the Beggar was a model and he was a millionaire named ‘Baron Hausberg’. Hughie was shocked to hear this. Further Alan continued that Baron Hausberg had a strange desire that Trevor wanted to paint him as a beggar. But when Hughie dropped the sovereign Baron Hausberg was amazed at the humanity behind the poverty of Hughie Erskine. Alan also said that Baron Hauberg had enquired everything about Hughie and he would invest his sovereign.</p>
                  <h5 class="card-title">Wedding of Hughie and Laura:</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">The next morning a man representing the Baron came to the house of Hughie and gave him a letter. In it was written:
                    “A wedding present to Hughie Erskine and Laura Merton, from an old beggar” and inside it was a cheque of ten thousand pounds. Hughie was surprised to see the letter an in his wedding Alan Trevor remained to be the best man for Hughie Erskine and Baron Hausberg gave a wonderful speech. 
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="card-title">Conclusion:</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Baron Hausberg in his speech mentioned the moral for the story: “millionaire models are rare enough; but, by Jove, model millionaires are rarer still!” Oscar Wilde focuses that Baron Hausberg reflected to be the model millionaire and he gives the moral to the readers through the character of Hughie Erskine that humanity is always appreciated. </p>

The only notion that he had in his life is to enjoy every moment. When his money started to decrease, he began the habit of borrowing money.

But the next day he met both Tom Ramsay and Cronshaw together moving to Monte Carlo which infuriated George. He felt that he was deceived and he was made a fool by his own brother Tom Ramsay. </p>
                  <h5 class="card-title">Conclusion:</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">‘The Ant and the Grasshopper’ is a story which gives blow to the hard-working people. The author reverses the concept of honesty. He recommends the human beings to do a smart work instead of hard work. He asks the readers to revise according to the present situation instead of relying on the old morals. </p>

                <p class="card-text">Philip comes home after four years of service in army.  He wakes up late and asks for breakfast to Mary, servant.  She says the Mrs. Higgins, the cook, would not give breakfast for it is too late.  Philip asks Mary to inform that he needs a ham and an egg.  Mary goes into the house. Later Aunt Emily comes and feels bad that Mrs. Higgins would leave the job, because Philip has asked for breakfast at 10AM.  Mrs. Higgins fights with Philip that she would not prepare breakfast.  Philip, immediately, asks her to resign.  She gets frightened and agrees to bring him a ham, egg and coffee.  Aunt Emily feels the change in Philip.  She feels happy about Philip’s action.
                  Philip goes into the kitchen and Uncle James comes.  He scolds Philip for being late.  Aunt Emily warns him to be polite with Philip for he has changed a lot.  Uncle James says that he would talk with Philip about his future.  Uncle James reads paper in the hall and he sleeps.  Philip comes in his dream and he says that he wishes to become an Architect.  He smokes in front of Uncle James.  Uncle James scolds him to behave well. 
                  Uncle James asks Philip to join him in his jam business.  Philip says no for his ideas.  He asks his uncle to leave him on his own.  Uncle James says that he cannot be independent until the age of 25, according to his father’s will.  Philip takes out his gun and threatens his uncle to accept with what he says.  Uncle James argues, so Philip takes out a bomb too.  Uncle James is threatened and agrees with Philip.  He fears of death.</p>

Uncle James feels relieved.  Philip says that he wishes to sell his revolver, Uncle James laughs at hearing the word revolver.  Philip agrees to join him the very day to do business.
                  After the dream, Uncle James behaves in a silly way.  He laughs awkwardly many times.  He smiles for no reason.  He feels much relieved because Philip does not behave like how he behaved in his dream.</p>
                  <h5 class="card-title">Conclusion:</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">In the play Uncle James, in the dream, does not understand the real thoughts of Philip.  Mary and Aunt Emily are able to understand Philip and they act as the bridge between Philip and Uncle James.</p>

          The Solitary Reaper - <strong>William Wordsworth</strong>
        </button>
      </h2>
      <div id="collapseOne" class="accordion-collapse collapse show" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">
        <div class="accordion-body ">
            <div class="card" style="width: 100%;">
                <div class="card-body course-panel">
                  <p class="card-text">William Wordsworth is one of the most important English poets and a founder of the Romantic Movement of English literature, a style of writing that focuses on emotion and imagination. Wordsworth became known as a Lakeland Poet because of the area where he lived, which is renowned for its beautiful, wild landscapes, charming pastures, and countless lakes. He was often called a nature poet because of his emphasis on the connection between humans and the natural world. He became widely successful and was named Poet Laureate of England in 1843. </p>
                  <p class="card-text">'The Solitary Reaper' was written on November 5, 1805, and published in 1807 in the collection Poems, in Two Volumes. This poem is unique because while most of Wordsworth's work is based closely on his own experiences, 'The Solitary Reaper' is based on the experience of someone else, author and friend Thomas Wilkinson, as described in his Tours to the British Mountains. </p>
                  <p class="card-text">The poem, like most of Wordsworth's poetry, is distinguished by its straightforward use of language and meter as well as its natural theme and imagery. It reflects Wordsworth's belief in the importance of the natural world, the power of memory and the human mind, and his first principle of poetry - that poetry should be written to provide pleasure through a rhythmic and powerful expression of emotion and leave readers with 'a spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings' long after it is read. </p>
                  <p class="card-text">The poem begins with the speaker asking readers to behold a young girl ‘reaping and singing by herself’ in a field. The song the girl sings is a sad song, and anyone passing by, the speaker says, should either stop and listen or 'gently pass' so as not to disturb her. He is so struck by the sad beauty of her song that the whole valley seems to overflow with its sound. </p>
                  <p class="card-text">In the second stanza, the speaker compares the girl's singing to that of a nightingale and a cuckoo bird. He says that the song she sings is more welcome than any nightingale might sing to weary travellers in the desert, and the sound of the her voice is more thrilling to hear than the cuckoo-bird in spring. He is utterly enchanted, although as we see in the next stanza, he cannot understand the language of the song and so cannot say what the song is about. </p>
                  <p class="card-text">In the third stanza, the speaker tries to imagine what the song might be about. Given its sad tune, he speculates that her song might be about some past sorrow, pain or loss of old, unhappy things' or battles fought long ago. Or perhaps, he says, it is a humbler, simpler song about some present sorrow, pain, or loss, a „matter of to-day.</p>
                  <p class="card-text">The poem ends as the speaker understands that whatever the girl sings about does not matter. It is the beauty of the song and her singing that touches his heart and lingers in his mind, giving him joy as he travels up the hill and carries her song with him long after he can no longer hear it.</p>
                  <p class="card-text">Wordsworth’s poems are known for their simplicity, humanity and adoration of nature. His poetry deals with the common folk from ordinary life and the poem The Solitary Reaper is an example for it. The poem is filled with lot of imageries like ‘vale’, ‘Arabian sands’ and ‘hill’ and the poet has used metaphor to compare the song of the reaper to the birds.   </p>

                  <p class="card-text">‘The Slave’s Dream’ is by H.W. Longfellow portrays the lost dreams and ambitions of a slave. The poem describes a slave’s dying moment in a dream. This last dream gives a series to a number of fantasies which reflects the desires of his life. The slave is captivated by the images of his family and native land. The sights and sounds of his native land and the free life he had once led among his people are vividly recalled by the native. The various whims and emotions of the slave are seen in the poem. The poem is a celebration of liberty and dignity.</p>
                  <p class="card-text">At the beginning of the poem, the slave is very tired from the day’s work and was lying on the ground unable to realise the master’s whippings and the sun’s heat. In an unclear sleep, he looks at his native land. He imagines himself riding a boat happily on the banks of the river Niger. Further, he dreams of his ‘dark-eyed queen’ and his children. He dreams that they clung to his neck, hold his hand and kiss him. On looking at his family in the dreams, a tear drop falls from the eye lids of the slave. </p>
                  <p class="card-text">Soon he fancies himself as a king riding a horse with a sword. On his ride, he sees the American bird, flamingos and he tries to fly with the bird. He also hears the water stream which sounded to him like ‘a roll of drums’. He also sees the caffre huts, tamarind tree and hears to the screams of the hyena and river elephant crushing the reeds. </p>
                  <p class="card-text">As he was disturbed by the images of the forest in his dream, he observes that they forests shout to him about freedom in thousand tongues. The desert talks to hi of an uninhabited freedom. The slave continuously travels in the landscapes of his dream and gives out a vague smile. Soon, the slave did not feel the beatings of the master and the burning heat because his soul breaks from the body and enters into the lands of eternal sleep. The fetters of his body are the only thing left behind in the land. The poem ends with a message that the slaves can only dream about freedom and no master can have the control over soul. </p>
                  <p class="card-text">The poem explicates much imagery like the landscapes of dream, flamingos, river horse, hyena, caffre huts, and tamarind tree. The poem also deals with similes. The poet compares the sound of water stream to the music of drums as he says, “And it passed, like a roll of drums”. Even the poem deals with personification when the poet describes the forests as a person singing of liberty. The poem says “the forests, with myriad tongues shouted of liberty”. Similarly, Death is also personified when the poet says “Death illuminated the Land of Sleep”.</p>

                  <h5 class="card-title">Introduction:</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">Robert Frost is a twentieth century American poet and the winner of Pulitzer Prize for his poem four times. Famous works of Frost include “Fire and Ice”, “Mending Wall”, “Birches”, “Home Burial” and “Stopping by Woods”. He deals realistically with his world through man and nature. He is popularly called as ‘Nature Poet’ and he also talks about humanity providing in his poems the philosophical intimations of life.  </p>
                  <h5 class="card-title">About the Poem:</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">The poem “The Road Not Taken” is a narrative poem. The poem is written with a rhyme scheme ABAAB. The poem widely deals with choices and decisions of life. The poem focuses on ideas of individuality and reflecting on the past experiences to draw wisdom from them. </p>
                  <h5 class="card-title">Analysis of the Poem:</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">The poem begins with the poet standing at the crossroads in a forest during an autumn season. He stands right before the diverged roads for a longer time totally confused. Being one traveller, he could not travel on both the roads. Hence, he is perplexed to choose one of the roads to travel. Later, he looks at the first road and finds that the road gets into‘undergrowth’. While the first road is seen to have been used by many people, he looks at the second road which looked grassy and ‘wanted wear’. After a long thought, he chooses the less travelled road and kept the first one ‘for some other day’. He is not sure about the path of the second road and he assures that he might have a chance of returning back. However, he wanted to have new experiences and new discoveries and so he selects the new road. In the final stanza, the poet says that he is happy about his choice of taking the less travelled road and ‘that has made all the difference’.</p>
                  <p class="card-text">‘The road’ in the title of the poem symbolises life’s decisions. Life is full of choices, some are predetermined and some are decided on the spot. The choices people make in their life not only shape their life but also can make or break it. While the poet says, “I shall be telling this with a sigh”, it becomes clear that the poet thinks that he made a wrong decision. However, in the last line when he says “that has made all the difference” it proves his satisfaction of the choice he made. The road that one chooses can be made of challenges but they all have to be explored but the choice that one makes will redefine the person and bring forth his strength outward. </p>
                  <h5 class="card-title">Conclusion:</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">The poet uses beautiful imageries while describing the ‘yellow woods’ and ‘diverged roads’. The poem is affluent in style and diction. The poem travels on an ambiguous note whether it is the poet’s impactful choice or about the speaker’s way of interpreting the choice whose effect is unclear.</p>

            A Ring To Me Is Bondage - <strong>Mina Assadi</strong>

                <h5 class="card-title">Introduction:</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Mina Assadi is an Iranian writer who lives in exile in Sweden. She has written on a variety of controversial and provocative topics. She has championed the cause of women, children and political refugees. Her works are banned in Iran because she speaks and writes against the regime of Iran which does not give women equal rights with men. </p>
                <h5 class="card-title">About the Poem: </h5>
                <p class="card-text">‘A Ring to Me is Bondage’ seeks to highlight the marginalisation of women in society, in religion and in family. The ring in the title of the poem serves as a metaphor to compare the wedding ring that every woman is entitled to.  According to the poet, the bond between a man and woman in a marriage must be a beautiful relationship and not slavery. </p>
                <h5 class="card-title">Analysis of the poem:</h5>
                <p class="card-text">The poem begins with questioning the faith on God. The poet describes the form of prayer. Since she belongs to Islamism, she says prayer is not a conventional practice and cannot be done traditionally. It is a communication to God that can be better performed in the garden of “silk tassel trees” with freedom. She also questions of the happiness in Kibla and says that happiness to her is walking through the garden hearing to the music of sparrows. </p>
                <p class="card-text">In the second stanza she criticizes the society. She says she does not know the difference between one land and the other. According to her, all are human beings. She further contradicts certain terms. She says being alone is happiness, home to her is a desert and whatever that makes her sad she calls it as love. This line reflects Milton’s thought from Paradise Lost as he says “Solitude is sometimes the best society”.  Since she is exiled from her family and her country she shows an unemotional fervour in the poem. </p>
                <p class="card-text">Further, she looks at the world in a different way. She says what the world calls as richness is not richness to her. In her opinion, a five pound note represents wealth. She insists on freedom to even the lesser beings. She calls the people who separate the fish from water as murderer, the person who picks the flower form the stem as blind and the one who has a cage with him as a ‘Goaler’. To Assadi, a meaningless smile is utter joy and useless thoughts are walls. Ultimately, she reflects that the world circles on several factors that attempt to imprison the human minds in the representation of tradition and convention s. Through the poem she responds to come out of it and live an independent life. The poem has several imageries like cage, sea, fish and flower bush in order to describe the meaning of liberty.</p>
                <h5 class="card-title">Conclusion:</h5>
                <p class="card-text">The poet Mina Assadi reflects on the prisons of life. Particularly to a woman, the society, religion and family control her. According to the poet, freedom is something that can be sought through knowing oneself. She pleads to the readers to increase the positive spirit and look at the world breaking the conventional norms of the society. </p>
